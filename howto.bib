  title = {A Displacement and Amplitude Score Employing an Optical Flow Technique},

  pages = {1297--1308},
  abstract = {A field verification measure for precipitation forecasts is presented
	that combines distance and amplitude
	
	errors. It is based on an optical flow algorithm that defines a vector
	field that deforms, or morphs, one image
	
	to match another. When the forecast field is morphed to match the
	observation field, then for any point in the
	
	observation field, the magnitude of the displacement vector gives
	the distance to the corresponding forecast
	
	object (if any), while the difference between the observation and
	the morphed forecast is the amplitude error.
	
	Similarly, morphing the observation field onto the forecast field
	gives displacement and amplitude errors for
	
	forecast features. If observed and forecast features are separated
	by more than a prescribed maximum search
	
	distance, they are not matched to each other, but they are considered
	to be two separate amplitude errors: a
	
	missed event and a false alarm. The displacement and amplitude error
	components are combined to produce
	
	a displacement and amplitude score (DAS). The two components are weighted
	according to the principle
	
	that a displacement error equal to the maximum search distance is
	equivalent to the amplitude error that
	
	would be obtained by a forecast and an observed feature that are too
	far apart to be matched. The new score,
	
	DAS, is applied to the idealized and observed test cases of the Spatial
	Verification Methods Intercomparison
	
	Project (ICP) and is found to accurately measure displacement errors
	and quantify combined displacement
	
	and amplitude errors reasonably well, although with some limitations
	due to the inability of the image matcher
	
	to perfectly match complex fields.},

  title = {Optical Flow for Verification},
  journal = {Weather and Forecasting},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {25},
  pages = {1479--1494},
  abstract = {Modern numerical weather prediction (NWP) models produce forecasts
	that are gridded spatial fields.
	
	Digital images can also be viewed as gridded spatial fields, and as
	such, techniques from image analysis can be
	
	employed to address the problem of verification of NWP forecasts.
	One technique for estimating how images
	
	change temporally is called optical flow, where it is assumed that
	temporal changes in images (e.g., in a video)
	
	can be represented as a fluid flowing in some manner. Multiple realizations
	of the general idea have already
	
	been employed in verification problems as well as in data assimilation.
	Here, a specific formulation of optical
	
	flow, called Lucas–Kanade, is reviewed and generalized as a tool for
	estimating three components of forecast
	
	error: intensity and two components of displacement, direction and
	distance. The method is illustrated first on
	
	simulated data, and then on a 418-day series of 24-h forecasts of
	sea level pressure from one member [the
	
	Global Forecast System (GFS)–fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–National
	Center for Atmo-
	
	spheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5)] of the University of Washington’s
	Mesoscale Ensemble system.
	
	The simulation study confirms (and quantifies) the expectation that
	the method correctly assesses forecast
	
	errors. The method is also applied to a real dataset consisting of
	418 twenty-four-hour forecasts spanning
	
	2 April 2008–2 November 2009, demonstrating its value for analyzing
	NWP model performance. Results
	
	reveal a significant intensity bias in the subtropics, especially
	in the southern California region. They also
	
	expose a systematic east-northeast or downstream bias of approximately
	50 km over land, possibly due to the
	
	treatment of terrain in the coarse-resolution model.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a stochastic weather generator based on analogues
	of circulation (AnaWEGE). Analogues of circulation have been a promising
	paradigm to analyse climate variability and its extremes. The weather
	generator uses precomputed analogues of sea-level pressure over the
	North Atlantic. The stochastic rules of the generator constrain the
	continuity in time of the simulations. The generator then simulates
	spatially coherent time series of a climate variable, drawn from
	meteorological observations. The weather generator is tested for
	European temperatures, and for winter and summer seasons. The biases
	in temperature quantiles and autocorrelation are rather small compared
	to observed variability. The ability of simulating extremely hot
	summers and cold winters is also assessed.},
